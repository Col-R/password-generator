Little password generator I made for my household to use. It's not the most secure thing in the world, but it's better than using the same password for everything. It's also a good way to get a random string of characters for whatever you need it for.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

In the future I plan on adding some fun little design elements, like a dark and light mode or a palette switcher.
I'd also like to make this into a browser extension so it's available whenever you need it.
